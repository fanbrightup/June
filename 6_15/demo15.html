  <p>It's usually bad practice to use a class name that explicitly describes how an element should look, such as the highlighted portion of CSS below:</p>

  <pre>
      <code>
          <mark>.greenText</mark> {
              color: green;
          }
      </code>
  </pre>
<p>So, I went back and read the instructions myself to see what I'd done wrong. They said:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Remove the tray from the box. Pierce the overwrap several times with a fork and cook on High for <mark>15 minutes</mark>, rotating it half way through.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought he'd told me <em>fifty</em>. No wonder it exploded in my microwave.</p>

<p>Gaudí's work was essentially useful. <span lang="es">La Casa Milà</span> is an apartment building and <em>real people </em> live there.</p>
